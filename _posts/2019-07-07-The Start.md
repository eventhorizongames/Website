How to start? That is a heavy question... EventHorizon Games Studio is just a small project, game studio, I am starting. The branding is just something I just want to get started for my self. I want to see it go from here to greater things. My main goal it to create something that helps eas the development of games. Be that my own personal or if somebody finds it useful that would be great as well.

As to what the goal of this project is right now, I would say is to just work on what I want, but try and tie it back the greater EventHorizon Games branding. The main focus is getting the EventHorizon game development platform to a place that can be deployed and used with minimal effort.
